This is a testing ground for things I want to checkout before implementing on other repositories.

## Issue Templates

I decided to try moving from a full Markdown template for issues to [GitHub Issue
Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
which uses a YAML header to define fields that are to be completed.
