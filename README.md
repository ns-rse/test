# Testing, testing, check 1-2

This is a testing ground for things I want to checkout before implementing on other repositories, mostly relating to
GitHub Actions and templates but may involve other aspects.

Most commits are directly to `main` so I can see the impact immediately but some require branches to trigger actions.

## Issue Templates

I decided to try moving from a Markdown based template for issues to [GitHub Issue
Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)
which uses a YAML to define fields that are to be completed. These files can be found under `~/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
